# Portfolio Projects
This repository is part of my portfolio project, where I aim to showcase my data analysis skills and proficiency in working with Excel, SQL databases, and Tableau.

## Requirements
- MySQL server (Version X.X.X) with appropriate privileges to access the database.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data`: Contains datasets formated in csv files.
- `sql_queries`: Contains SQL queries used to interact with the data.
- `output`: Stores the generated visualizations and analysis results in Tableau Dashboards.

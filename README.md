# Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio project repository. This repository is a showcase of my data analysis skills, demonstrating my proficiency in utilizing tools such as Excel, SQL databases, and Tableau to derive actionable insights from data.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several sections to facilitate easy navigation and understanding:

- `tableau`: Here you'll find visualizations and analyses crafted using Tableau, providing insightful dashboards for data representation.
- `sql_queries`: This section houses the SQL queries developed to interact with and extract data from various databases.

## Project List

1. **Boston 2022 Redistricting Map Proposal**: Leveraged Excel for data preprocessing, SQL for data querying, and Tableau for interactive visualization, I contributed to the creation of a map proposal during the 2022 Boston Redistricting Process, adhering to federal guidelines and community response
2. **Box Office Statistical Analysis**: Ran a linear regression in STATA to evaluate key factors impacting movie earnings, analyzed the accuracy of the model using outputs like adjusted R-square and RMSE, and used the regression results to run predictive models to forecast the performance of upcoming films at the box office
3. **Cyclistic Case Study**: Utilized SQL for data analysis and Tableau Public for visualization to find distinct patterns between annual and casual bike-sharing riders, thereby guiding the formulation of marketing strategies to boost membership growth
